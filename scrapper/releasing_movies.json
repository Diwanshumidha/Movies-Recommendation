Then 27 feminist media groups participated in a two year bi-monthly video exchange. After giving a brief introduction through clips and art work, this less than ten minute video quickly explores 13 other 1970s feminist media that are MISSING / UNKNOWN / UNSHOWN. Spunky and quirky, the work could evolve into a Feminist/Gender and Cinema Studies teaching tool and put some of this germinal feminist work back on the cinema history map.",

The film contemplates perception, clairvoyance, and whether the present can be seen through the lens of memory, blurring the lines between past, present, and future. As the voice moves through decaying structures, it reflects on human impermanence and defiance of time. Vignettes of past lives illustrate universal human experiences. The film concludes by pondering existence, consciousness, and humanity’s drive to create meaning amidst an indifferent universe, challenging viewers to reflect on their own place in time and memory.",
